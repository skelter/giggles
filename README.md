Let's create a LISP inspired by Clojure.

We'll be creating at least one language, possibly more.  We are primarily exploring.

Things I loved about Clojure:
- use of [] to help the syntax instead of scheme's inner (()).
- persistent immutable structures: lists, vectors, maps and sets.
- frequent laziness.
- repl

Other Clojure projects I love:
- GorillaREPL
- CIDER in emacs

Language features I would like to explore:
- small memory footprint and fast startup


Possible low-level implementation languages
- Go
- Rust
- CommonLISP
- Pharo
- D

We shall not C++.
