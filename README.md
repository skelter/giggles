Let's create a LISP inspired by Clojure.

We'll be creating at least one language, possibly more.  We are primarily exploring.

Things I loved about Clojure:
- use of [] to help the syntax instead of scheme's inner (()).
- persistent immutable structures: lists, vectors, maps and sets.
- frequent laziness.
- repl

Other Clojure projects I love:
- GorillaREPL
- CIDER in emacs
- I gave up on pixelang.

Language Tools to keep in mind:
- MPS
- Moose
- Glamorous tookit
- Antlr 4
- Lexx, yacc, bison

Language features I would like to explore:
- small memory footprint and fast startup
- Clojure syntax and semantics

Possible low-level implementation languages and components
- Go
- Rust
- CommonLISP
- Pharo
- D
- LLVM
- ChickenScheme

We shall not C++.
